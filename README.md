Hangman
=======

Hangman game I made in python over summer of 2014. First fairly large python project. Uses tkinter for a simple, not-too-ugly GUI and a random word API to keep things interesting and occasionally impossible. Feel free to poke around, tell me where my code sucks, use it for your own project, or just have fun playing the game!
